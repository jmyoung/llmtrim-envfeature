# Contributing to llmtrim

Thanks for your interest! llmtrim is a static, deterministic LLM prompt compressor:
zero auxiliary model calls, every transform measured with the real target tokenizer.

## Ground rules

Four principles guide every change:

- **Simplicity first:** minimum code that solves the problem; no speculative abstraction.
- **Surgical changes:** touch only what the change requires.
- **Code universally:** text processing must handle any language/locale, not just English
  (detect the language, use the matching resource; prefer Unicode-aware operations).
- **Goal-driven:** turn the task into a verifiable test, then make it pass.

## Development

```bash
cargo build                  # debug build
cargo test                   # run the suite (deterministic, no network)
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo fmt --all
cargo build --features live  # the bench network path (async-openai + tokio)
```

CI runs fmt, clippy (`-D warnings`), and the test suite on Linux, macOS, and Windows. Keep all three green.

Enable the local git hooks (mirror of CI plus a gitleaks secret scan; needs `gitleaks` or Docker):

```bash
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

## Adding a compression stage

Stages implement the `Transform` trait (`src/gate.rs`) and are assembled in
`stages_for` (`src/lib.rs`). A stage:

1. Declares a `GateKind`: `InputTokens` (reverted if it doesn't reduce tokens),
   `OutputShaping`, or `Structural`.
2. Mutates the JSON-backed `Request` at JSON-pointer addresses (lossless by construction
   for any field it doesn't touch).
3. Adds a config flag in `DenseConfig` (`src/config.rs`) and is wired into a preset.
4. Ships with unit tests proving the token win and quality behavior.

Lossy stages stay **off by default** and are quality-checked offline (see README §6).

## Pull requests

- One logical change per PR; every changed line should trace to the stated goal.
- Add or update tests for new behavior.
- Run fmt + clippy + tests before pushing.
- Fill in the PR template.
