//! llmtrim CLI.

//! Network-free surface: `compress` reads a provider request body on stdin and writes the

Get started:
  setup      Set everything up and start saving (CA, env, autostart, daemon)
  status     Show the savings dashboard + interceptor health  [aliases: monitor, gain]
  wrap       Launch an agent (claude, codex, …) routed through the interceptor

Daemon:
  start      Start the background interceptor (no-op if already running)
  stop       Stop the background interceptor
  autostart  Run the interceptor at login (--off to disable)

When something's wrong:
  doctor     Check the install end-to-end and explain anything broken
  update     Update llmtrim to the latest release
  uninstall  Undo everything `setup` did

Pipes & one-shots:
  compress   Compress a request from stdin to stdout
  send       Compress a request, send it to the provider, print the response
  serve      Run the HTTPS interceptor in the foreground
  ca         Print the local CA certificate path and how to trust it

Measurement (dev):
  eval       Measure retrieval recall + token savings on a corpus
  bench      A/B benchmark: tokens saved vs quality retained, on a real model
  discover   Scan the capture corpus for where tokens still escape compression

Options:
{options}
Run `llmtrim help <command>` for details on any command.
