//! Stage T — tool-output compression (feature #1).
//!
//! Tool results (logs, diffs, grep output) are the bulk of an agent's context and the
//! noisiest: 10k-line build logs around a handful of errors, 200-line diffs changing
//! three lines, grep dumps with one relevant hit per file. The prose-oriented stages
//! (retrieve, ngram) don't fit this shape. This stage detects the *kind* of each tool
//! output and routes it to a purpose-built lexical compressor:
//!
//! - **log**  → level/stack-aware line selection (+ Drain template collapse, [`template`])
//! - **diff** → file/hunk capping + context trimming
//! - **grep** → per-file match selection
//!
//! All three keep the structurally important lines (errors, changes, query-relevant
//! matches), window the rest under an adaptive budget ([`crate::stages::sizing`]), and
//! replace dropped runs with a positional elision marker (`[… N lines omitted …]`, like
//! the `retrieve` stage). If the agent needs the dropped detail it re-runs the tool —
//! fresher than a stored copy, and what a tool-using agent does naturally. Lossy,
//! `InputTokens`-gated (reverts if it doesn't cut tokens), `Content`-scoped. Zero model
//! calls.
//!
//! Note on universality: the level/failure keywords scored below are tokens
//! *machine-emitted* by runtimes and build tools (`ERROR`, `FATAL`, `Traceback`,
//! `panicked`), not human prose, so a fixed set is appropriate. Locale-specific terms
//! from the user's request are handled by the query-overlap bonus, which is
//! Unicode-segmented via [`lex_words`].
