# llmtrim

**Cut ~66% off your LLM bill.** A drop-in local HTTPS proxy that compresses every LLM
request and reply (input, output, and cache) with zero extra model calls. Works with
Claude Code, Cursor, Cline, and any tool that talks to OpenAI / Anthropic / Google /
DeepSeek / Mistral & co. Answers unchanged: every cut is re-counted with the provider's
real tokenizer and auto-reverted if it doesn't save.

```bash
npm install -g @llmtrim/cli && llmtrim setup
# open a new shell, then watch the bill shrink:
llmtrim status --watch
```

`setup` is transparent and fully reversible (`llmtrim uninstall`): a local CA, a proxy
block in your shell profile, a background service. Everything runs locally; nothing is
ever sent to us.

This package installs a prebuilt native binary for your platform (Linux, macOS, Windows;
x64 & arm64). No Rust toolchain needed.
